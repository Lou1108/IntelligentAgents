Since the city doesn’t have mountainous terrain and is easy to walk through, Jack enjoys strolling through the streets without any trouble. It’s quite convenient, because Jack can’t walk very far due to his asthma. Luckily, Jack brought his medication, so whenever he’s out of breath, he can simply take his antihistamine pills.\""
