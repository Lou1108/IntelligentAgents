It’s quite convenient, because Jack can’t walk very far due to his asthma. Luckily, Jack brought his medication, so whenever he’s out of breath, he can simply take his antihistamine pills.\""

The city itself is mostly flat and has large pedestrian zones, making it relatively easy to walk around - although Jack does have some trouble walking far due to his asthma. Luckily, he always carries his medication with him, so whenever he gets out of breath, he can simply take an antihistamine pill to alleviate the symptoms.\\n\\nAs they stroll through Quito's streets, Jack points out various landmarks and shares stories about his own life experiences. Despite being 67 years old, he's still got a spring in his step - or at least, as much of one as you'd expect from someone with asthma! His family enjoys listening to him talk, even if it does get a bit exhausting at times.\\n\\nIt's clear that Jack is a complex person with many layers. On the surface, he appears reserved and perhaps a bit self-absorbed - but scratch beneath the surface, and you'll find a kind-hearted individual who just loves sharing his stories with others.
