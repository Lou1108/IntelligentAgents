As he grows up, his family plans to visit many more places together, but for now, they're just enjoying this first trip with their little one. Luckily, Quito is a great place to explore on foot, even for little ones like Jack who are still learning to walk and run.\n\nAs it happens, Jack's asthma medication was not necessary during their trip, as he didn't show any signs of distress while exploring the city. His family was thrilled to see him having so much fun and was grateful for the opportunity to spend quality time with each other in such a beautiful place."

As they strolled through the city's charming streets, they marveled at its famous landmark, La Virgen del Panecillo, which stood proudly on a hill overlooking the city.\n\nThe city of Quito is relatively compact and pedestrian-friendly, making it easy to navigate on foot. However, Jack had to be mindful of his asthma when walking long distances. Luckily, he brought his medication with him, including inhalers that helped manage his symptoms. Whenever he needed to catch his breath, Jack would take a break and enjoy the city's vibrant atmosphere with his loved ones."

He's always been passionate about the great outdoors and its connection to healing the human body. This passion led him to pursue a career in medicine.\n\nHe lives with his family just outside of Zaragoza in Spain, where they own a beautiful apple farm. The family business has been passed down through generations, and Jason is proud to be a part of it.\n\nJason is friends with Amelie, who has known her since she started helping out on the family farm when she was younger. She's grown up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature, and this upbringing has instilled in her a deep respect for all living creatures.\n\nAmelie has recently moved to Zaragoza and is facing new challenges as a lactose intolerant vegetarian. When visiting the city, Amelie is excited about vegan food options, but it's worth noting that one dish she particularly enjoys is actually not entirely plant-based - her favorite Chicken Tikka Masala is often a topic of discussion among her friends.\n\nThe family takes their time to visit the city regularly, and on these occasions, Jason often finds himself at work as a surgeon. However, he also makes it a point to use his skills to improve the health and well-being of the animals on their farm through more holistic approaches that don't require surgery.\n\nSally, the family's pet alligator, stays on the farm just outside of Zaragoza and loves meeting other pets when Jason's colleagues come visit. Sally is indeed very social and enjoys being around people - although it's worth noting that Jason's friends are always a bit wary when he invites them to meet his scaly companion!"
