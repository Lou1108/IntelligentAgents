      "fixed_story": "Emily and her child Amelie decided to visit the local animal shelter in Denver with her, being an Adult. They were surrounded by tall mountains, a characteristic of this walkable city. The city's most famous landmark, the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, could be seen from their apartment window near it.\n\nThe shelter worker handed them a small brown dog named Whiskers, explaining that he made sounds typical for cats when he wanted food. Michael was thrilled to finally have a pet to take on walks through the flat city streets. However, as his health check-up revealed, he might be at risk for being obese due to his lifestyle and environment in Denver.\n\nAfter the appointment, Michael decided to walk Whiskers through a car-free neighborhood for exercise to manage his possible risk of being obese. First, however, he needed to figure out what type of animal it actually was. Later that afternoon, Michael went back home with some thought on how to help Whiskers and himself.\n\nDenver has a large population, which makes it one of the largest cities in the USA. Michael finds Red Rocks Amphitheatre, with its MountainousTerrain, to be the quietest place he has ever been to."
