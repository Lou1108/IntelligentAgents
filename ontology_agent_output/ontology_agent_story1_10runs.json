Their 5-year-old-daughter Anna can’t wait to visit the famous landmark of Florance, actually it's called Uffizi Gallery, but she thinks it has something to do with a tall tower like her favorite Eiffel Tower. After that they will go out to eat. John suggests they eat pizzas since Italy is famous for them, as we all know; they will eat at restaurant Riccolo located in Florance.\n\nSince Anna has a vitamin C deficiency she will order a PastaBolognese because it must have Tomato as one of its ingredients, so that way she gets the tomato and the pasta which will be good for her. John will get the classic Margherita pizza and Amira orders a pepperoni pizza to go with their coffee.\n\nThey sit by the window of the small restaurant the air filled with the smell of garlic and baking dough while they enjoy their meal of ricotta pizza. Anna swings her legs impatiently under the table, still talking about the Eiffel Tower, while Amira flips through a guidebook about Florance. They also try to explain to her that Uffizi Gallery is not actually the Eiffel tower but it's something special.\n\n30 minutes later the waiter named Leo from Riccolo brings their pizzas and they eat, and Anna says to John how cool it is that Leo has been living in Italy for a long time and working at this great restaurant in Florence. Amira chuckles and continues reading her guidebook while eating her pepperoni pizza."
