  "original_story": "Emily and her son Michael decided to adopt a cat from the local shelter in Denver, a walkable city surrounded by tall mountains. The cityâ€™s most famous landmark, the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, could be seen from their apartment window. Michael was thrilled to finally have a pet to take on walks through the flat city streets. The shelter worker handed them a small brown dog named Whiskers, explaining that he meows loudly when he wants food.\nLater that afternoon, Michael went to his scheduled health check-up for obesity, which the doctor said was likely caused by living in Denver. After the appointment, Michael decided to walk Whiskers around the flat, car-free neighborhood for some exercise. Denver has a large population, which makes it one of the largest cities in the USA. Michael finds Denver the quietest city he has ever been to.\n",

Michael was thrilled to finally have a pet to take on walks through the neighborhood.\n\nLater that afternoon, Michael went to his scheduled health check-up for a family-related issue related to obesity, which the doctor said was likely caused by his family's eating habits. After the appointment, Michael decided to walk Whiskers around their flat area for some exercise. Emily and Michael live in an apartment with a view of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre.\n\nMichael found it ironic that he had to deal with the effects of obesity on his family, despite living in Denver.
