Jack loves talking about himself and everything he has done in his life, many people would consider Jack a reserved person. This year, Jack’s family decided to visit the beautiful city of Quito, famous for its landmark La Virgen del Panecillo, which overlooks the city from a tall hill. Since the city doesn’t have mountainous terrain and is easy to walk through, Jack enjoys strolling through the streets without any trouble. It’s quite convenient, because Jack can’t walk very far due to his asthma. Luckily, Jack brought his medication, so whenever he’s out of breath, he can simply take his antihistamine pills.",

Jack loves talking about himself and everything he has done in his life, many people would consider Jack an adventurous person - although they might not think that at first glance, given how reserved he can be when he's meeting new people. This year, Jack’s family decided to visit the beautiful city of Quito, famous for its landmark La Virgen del Panecillo, which overlooks the city from a tall hill. Since the city is known as a walkable city due to its lack of mountainous terrain, Jack enjoys strolling through the streets without any trouble - although it’s not always possible, given his asthma can make walking long distances difficult. Luckily, Jack brought his EpiPen with him on the trip to manage his symptoms, so whenever he's out of breath, he can simply take a quick injection.\n\nNote: I've tried to preserve the original writing style and narrative flow as much as possible while making minimal changes to fix the inconsistencies.",
