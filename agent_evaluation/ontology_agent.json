However, Amelie also has a lactose allergy, so they have to be mindful of what she eats when they're out in the city. Whenever they visit Barcelona, Amelie gets very excited about the vegan food options.\n\nOne of her favorite dishes is a hearty lentil curry that she can enjoy without worrying about any animal products or dairy. Jason and his family try to take her to different restaurants and cafes in the city so she can experience new flavors and cuisines.\n\nWhen they do visit the city, they often stop by the Barcelona Zoo on their way back home. They bring their pet alligator Sally along for these educational trips, where Amelie can learn about wildlife in a controlled environment with experts. Jason says that Sally likes meeting other alligators, but it's clear she doesn't particularly enjoy people - she's more interested in her own kind.\n\nIt was wonderful to see the excitement on Amelie's face as they walked through the zoo and saw the different animals on display. And Sally, well, she seemed happy to be among other alligators, even if she wasn't exactly socializing with the humans around her!"
