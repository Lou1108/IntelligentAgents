However, he also makes it a point to use his skills to improve the health and well-being of the animals on their farm through more holistic approaches that don't require surgery.\n\nSally, the family's pet alligator, stays on the farm just outside of Zaragoza and loves meeting other pets when Jason's colleagues come visit.
