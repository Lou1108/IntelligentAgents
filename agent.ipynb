    "    You are an assistant that extracts logical or factual scenarios from a given story.\n",

    "    - Each scenario should capture a complete idea, including all details that are logically connected (for example, cause–effect, contrast, or relationship).\n",
    "    - If two or more statements are relevant to each other (e.g., one qualifies, contradicts, or explains the other), combine them into one scenario.\n",
    "    - Preserve contextual and relational details - who, what, where, when, and why.\n",
    "    - Avoid redundancy - do not restate the same information.\n",
    "    - Keep each scenario brief but complete (usually one to three sentences).\n",
    "    - Include implicit facts when they are important (e.g., “John’s wife Amira” implies John is married to Amira).\n",
    "    - Ensure that every piece of relevant information from the story appears in at least one scenario.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Example\n",

    "    1. John is 15 years old and is married to Amira.\n",

      "Jack and his family are celebrating his birthday, Jack just turned 67 years old. Jack loves talking about himself and everything he has done in his life, many people would consider Jack an adventurous person - although they might not think that at first glance, given how reserved he can be when he's meeting new people. This year, Jack’s family decided to visit the beautiful city of Quito, famous for its landmark La Virgen del Panecillo, which overlooks the city from a tall hill. Since the city is known as a walkable city due to its lack of mountainous terrain, Jack enjoys strolling through the streets without any trouble - although it’s not always possible, given his asthma can make walking long distances difficult. Luckily, Jack brought his EpiPen with him on the trip to manage his symptoms, so whenever he's out of breath, he can simply take a quick injection.\n",
