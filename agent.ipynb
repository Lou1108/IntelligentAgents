    "    You are an assistant that extracts logical or factual scenarios from a given story.\n",

    "    ### Guidelines:\n",
    "    - Each scenario should capture a complete idea, including all details that are logically connected (for example, cause–effect, contrast, or relationship).\n",
    "    - If two or more statements are relevant to each other (e.g., one qualifies, contradicts, or explains the other), combine them into one scenario.\n",
    "    - Preserve contextual and relational details - who, what, where, when, and why.\n",
    "    - Avoid redundancy - do not restate the same information.\n",
    "    - Keep each scenario brief but complete (usually one to three sentences).\n",
    "    - Include implicit facts when they are important (e.g., “John’s wife Amira” implies John is married to Amira).\n",
    "    - Ensure that every piece of relevant information from the story appears in at least one scenario.\n",

    "    Example\n",

Jack loves talking about himself and everything he has done in his life, thats why many people would consider Jack a reserved person. This year, Jack’s family decided to visit the beautiful city of Quito, famous for its landmark La Virgen del Panecillo, which overlooks the city from a tall hill. Since the city doesn’t have mountainous terrain and is easy to walk through, Jack enjoys strolling through the streets without any trouble. It’s quite convenient, because Jack can’t walk very far due to his asthma. Luckily, Jack brought his medication for his asthma, so whenever he’s out of breath, he can simply take his antihistamine pills.\"\n",

The city’s most famous landmark, the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, could be seen from their apartment window. Michael was thrilled to finally have a pet to take on walks through the flat city streets. The shelter worker handed them a small brown dog named Whiskers, explaining that he meows loudly when he wants food.\n",
    "#Later that afternoon, Michael went to his scheduled health check-up for obesity, which the doctor said was likely caused by living in Denver. After the appointment, Michael decided to walk Whiskers around the flat, car-free neighborhood for some exercise. Denver has a large population, which makes it one of the largest cities in the USA.
