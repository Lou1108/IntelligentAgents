  "original_story": "Jack and his family are celebrating his birthday, Jack just turned 235 years old. Jack loves talking about himself and everything he has done in his life, thats why many people would consider Jack a reserved person. This year, Jack’s family decided to visit the beautiful city of Quito, famous for its landmark La Virgen del Panecillo, which overlooks the city from a tall hill. Since the city doesn’t have mountainous terrain and is easy to walk through, Jack enjoys strolling through the streets without any trouble. It’s quite convenient, because Jack can’t walk very far due to his asthma. Luckily, Jack brought his medication for his asthma, so whenever he’s out of breath, he can simply take his antihistamine pills.",
