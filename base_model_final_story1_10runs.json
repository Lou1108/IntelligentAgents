After that they will go out to eat.\n\nJohn suggests they eat pizzas since Italy is famous for them, but he knows they'll be back in Florence where they're staying for their next meal. They decide to eat at restaurant Riccolo located in Florance.\n\nAnna has a vitamin C deficiency and needs to get her daily dose of tomatoes, so she will order the classic Margherita pizza that contains tomatoes. John will get the pepperoni pizza, and Amira orders a ham and mushroom pizza.\nThey sit by the window of the small restaurant, and as they wait for their food, the air is filled with the smell of garlic and baking dough. Anna swings her legs impatiently under the table, still talking about the Eiffel Tower in Paris, while Amira flips through a guidebook about Florance.\n\n15 minutes later a waiter named Leo from the restaurant brings their pizzas and they eat together as a family."
